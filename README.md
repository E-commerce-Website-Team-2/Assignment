## Overview of API Specification 🤖💬
We have designed api specification on two things
- **Data Ingestion ⬇️🔄💾** <br>
   This is used to populate the products and category to thhe database on the respective json file provided.<br>
   The various api specification is mentioned below
   - Api to load the products into database via a post request 🛍️
     ```
     POST   /products
     Host: localhost
     Content-Type :application/json
     Content Length: 
     { - - - -  JSON of Products - - - - }
     ```

      Host: localhost
      Content-Type :application/json
      Content Length: 
      { - - - -  JSON of Products - - - - }
      ```
- **Data Query 🔍💻** <br>
   This is used to perform some operation to fetched data from databse via a get request.<br>
   The various api specification is mentioned below.
   - To answer a query that has been passed. This will then be routed to Unbxd Search API 🔎📦

<h2 id="data-ingestion-api">How to run data ingestion API 💻</h2>
DataIngestion folder consists of the data ingestion API. These are used to ingest the data into the postgresql databse. <br>
The below curl commamnds have to be run when inside DataIngestion folder:  
  
<br>

 This ingests the category table with the data present in category.json. 
  ```
  curl 127.0.0.1:6000/category -d @category.json -H Content-Type:application/json
  ```
  This ingests the prroducts table with the data present in product.json.
  
  ```
  curl 127.0.0.1:6000/products -d @out.json -H Content-Type:application/json
  ```


## How to run website via Docker 🐳
1. Fork the repository
2. Make sure to run the [data ingestion Api](#data-ingestion-api) for the first time 
3. Run the following docker command <br> `docker-compose up -d --build` in the Project directory.
4. The Application will be up and running at `localhost:8000`

## How to Run Website via Kubernetes ⚙️🕸️
There are two ways to run Kubernetes.
1. **Kind🐳🎓 using MacOS**
   <br>
   i. Apply metallb Manifest<br>
      ```
      kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.13.7/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml
      ```
   ii. Wait until the MetalLB pods (controller and speakers) are ready:<br>
      ```
       kubectl wait --namespace metallb-system \
                --for=condition=ready pod \
                --selector=app=metallb \
                --timeout=90s
      ```
    iii. Setup address pool used by lodbalancers<br>
      ```
       docker network inspect -f '{{.IPAM.Config}}' kind
      ```
      
      iv. Apply the contents<br>
      ```
        kubectl apply -f https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/examples/loadbalancer/metallb-config.yaml
      ```
    v.  Open a two terminals and run the following commands<br>
      ```
         kubectl port-forward deployment/dataapi 6000:6000
      ```
      ```
         kubectl port-forward deployment/api-backend 5000:5000
      ```
    vi. Make sure to run the [data ingestion Api](#data-ingestion-api) for the first time. <br>
    vii. Frontend Service will be up and running at http://localhost:5678.<br>

   To make the service running on a domain name.<br>
   <ul>
   <li>Run `sudo nano ~/etc/hosts`</li>
   <li>Add `kalidescopegear.com localhost` to the file.</li>
   <li>Save it and search for `kalidescopegear.com` in web browser.</li>     
   </ul> 
   <br>
2. **MiniKube🐳🔍 using MacOS**
   <br>
   i. Install the following commands
      ```
      brew install minikube
      ```
      ```
      brew install hyyperkit
      ```
   ii. Once installed start the minikube with hyperkit as the driver
      ```
      minikube start --driver=hyperkit
      ```
   iii. Make the hyperkit as the default driver

      ```
      minikube config set driver hyperkit
      ```
   iv. Open a two terminals and run the following commands
      ```
      kubectl port-forward deployment/dataapi 6000:6000
      ```
      ```
      kubectl port-forward deployment/api-backend 5000:5000
      ```
   v. Make sure to run the [data ingestion Api](#data-ingestion-api) for the first time. <br>
   vi. Run `minikube service frontend-service`.<br>

   To make the service running on a domain name we need to enable ingress.
   <ul>
   <li>Run `minikube add-ons enable ingress`.</li>
   <li> Keep track of the ip-address where the service is running. E.g. 192.168.49.2 </li>
   <li>Run `sudo nano ~/etc/hosts`</li>
   <li>Add `kalidescopegear.com {ip-address}` to the file.</li>
   <li>Save it and search for `kalidescopegear.com` in web browser.</li>
   </ul>
